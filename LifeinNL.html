	<h2>Dutch Culture</h2>
		<div class="cultureinfo">
			<img class="imgs" src="gogh.jpg">
			<h3 id="thingstodo">So many things to do!</h3>
				<p> There are lots of places to visit and things to do in The Netherlands. The Dutch are quite extroverted and love to attend to small restarurants, fairs, and go out with friends during the weekends. There are so many museums to visit like the Van Gogh museum or the Rijksmuseum. Dutch culture is full of famous paintings such as "The Girl with the Pearl Earring" by Vermeer, "Night Watch" by Rembrandt and of course many of Van Goghs works such as his self-portraits. There are lots of markets during the weekend that also allow you to try different dutch foods and buy fresh vegetables. There are lots of stores and everything is available. The only con is that stores close quite early. </p>

			<h3 id="traditions">Traditions</h3>
 				<p>Every year in the month of November until December 5th the country celebrates Sinterklaas. This is comparable to Santa Claus. Santa was actually inspired by Sinterklaas. In the month of novemeber children everywhere welcome him as he arrives in his boat. They set their shoes by the chimney every following night. They sing the Sinterklaas songs at night or read stories. They also put letters for Sinterklaas in their shoes or even a carrot for his horse. In the following morning the kids will find small treats or gifts in their shoes. A typical sweet is the Pepernoot which is made from speculaas. Finally, on December 5th, Sinterklaas' birthday, it is pakjesavond. Where the children will hear a knock on their door and see a bag full of big presents.</p>

 			<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
 				<p> As a main meal the Dutch will often eat stampot which is potatoes with kol and sausages. The Dutch love eating patat or fries with mayonaise. Stroopwafels which are thin wafels with syrup are one of the most famous sweets of The Netherlands. Poffertjes are small pancakes that are often paired with icing sugar. Bitterballen are the typical hapjes or appetizers that you often eat at social gatherings. They are fried snacks made out of a thick beef stew that is rolled into a ball and fried. </p>

	<h2>Moving Around</h2>
		<div class="moveinfo">
			<img class="imgs"  src="travel.png">
			<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>
				<p>The Netherlands is a small country and it is easy to travel around it. In just 3 hours you can get from one side of the country to the other. This allows for great travelling opportunities that don't require getting on a plane. Additionally, the surrounding countries like Belgium and germany are also accesible with short car rides. This is perfect for getting to know new places in a quick, easy, and less expensive way since you don't have to catch a flight.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moveinfo">
			<img class="imgs"  src="train.jpg">
			<h3 id="OV">Public Transport</h3>
					<p>Not only is travelling easy, but Holland has a great public transportation system. There are trains, buses, metros, and randstadrails that will take you pretty much anywhere. In fact, its easier to get around in public transportation in big cities. The train is accesible everywhere if you have the OV or Openbaar Vervoer chipcard which is a card that you put money in and scan when entering the bus, train, metro, etc.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moveinfo">
			<img class="imgs"  src="cars.jpg">
			<h3 id="cars">Cars</h3>
				<p>Owning a car is quite an invesment. To buy, fuel, and insure it can be really expensive and it is not allowed to buy it cheaper in another country and then import it. If you have a car, parking is a big nuissance especially in big cities. Finding a parking space is really difficult and you also have to pay. It can be quite expensive as well. Also, there can be lots of traffic. This is why a lot of people decide to just take public transportation.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moveinfo">
			<img class="imgs"  src="bike.jpg">
			<h3 id="bikes">Bikes</h3>
				<p> Of course you can't forget the bikes. The Netherlands is famous for its biking culture. Dutch people will bike everywhere no matter the weather. It is healthy, it doesn't cost anything, plus it is really safe because of the extra red lanes that are for bikers only. You will see families with small children bike everywhere. This is another great alternative for commuting to places, but make sure to always lock your bike safely when you park it. If you are planning on moving to Holland, I suggest you learn how to ride a bike.</p>
