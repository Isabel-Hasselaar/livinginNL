<h1>Housing</h1>
<p> If you're moving somewhere it's quite necessary to find a house or apartment where you can live, so in this page we'll give you some information and resources you can use. Houses and apartments in The Netherlands are quite small. Since everything is crowded together houses are often narrow and tall, so if you are used to and want to live in a huge spacious house then living in Holland may not be the best option for you unless you are willing to live further away from cities where houses are bigger, but not super big either. Gardens are also quite small and sometimes you don't even have one.</p>
<h2>Housing Shortage</h2>
<p>There is a bit of a housing shortage in The Netherlands which makes finding a place to live really difficult and expensice. It might take a long time before you find something. It could take months for expats to find a perfect place to live. Also, the closer you live to the big cities the more difficult and more expensive it will be.</p>
<h2>Where To look</h2>
<p>Here are some great resources that you can use to find out where to start looking for a place and how to best find a house as quickly as possible</p>
