	<h1>Living in NL</h1>
	<p> Welkom! Welcome! Moving is one of the most stressful things and it is especially difficult if you don't know anything about the country you're moving to. This site will be dedicated to all things The Netherlands so that you ex-pats can feel calmer and actually know what you're getting into. On the home page we'll talk all about the basics and in the different pages well dive deep into those unknown variables:<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Schools</li>
		<li>Housing</li>
		<li>what Life is Like</li>
		<li>Sights</li>
		<li>Traditions, Food, Facts, etc.</li>
		<li>Groups you can join as newcomers</li>
	</ul>
