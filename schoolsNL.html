		<h2 id="DE">Dutch Education</h2>
			<p>Of course you could be planning to have your children go to a dutch school. This makes sense if your kids are young and if you are planning to stay for a long time. There Dutch education system is great. It is divided into basisschool and middelbare school. This is similar to primary and secondary school. There are lots of primary schools everywhere in every town. They are small schools, but have lots of children in them. There is usually only one class per grade so kids will have the same peers in their class every year. In secondary education children are divided into three types of schools depending on their academic level. There is VMBO, Havo, and VWO, VMBO would be the lowest level and VWO the highest and most difficult. What level they go to will also determine their possibilities for universities. This system will allow them to spend time learning material that is appropriate for them with kids on their same level.</p>
